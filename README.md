Sorting Algorithm Benchmark :
This project implements three sorting algorithms: insertion sort, selection sort, and bubble sort. It includes benchmarking code to measure the runtime performance of these algorithms for various input sizes.

Th Purpose :
The purpose of this project is to compare the runtime performance of different sorting algorithms and understand how their efficiency varies with the size of the input array.

Requirements :
Python 3.9.1
Required Python packages:
numpy
matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

Step 1 :
git clone https://github.com/mohanchowdarysk1/DAA_Project1.git

Step 2 :
Install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install numpy matplotlib

Step 3 :
Navigate to the project directory:
cd DAA_Project1

Step 4 :
Run the benchmarking script:
python benchmark.py
This script will generate plots showing the runtime performance of Insertion sort, Selection sort, and Bubble sort for various input sizes.

Results :
The benchmarking results will be displayed as plots showing the Execution time (in seconds) versus the input size (number of elements in the array) for each sorting algorithm.
